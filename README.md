# Overview

I wanted to share all my works for more than six years of Studio startup & personal project for public usage. I am the founder of Richiesoft Studio where I build enormous app covering consumer, media & ad verticals. This project is one of the repo I had personally stored.

One point app to purchase domains, manage them and take care of your entire online hosting, powered by GoDaddy and a product of Richiesoft Inc, this takes you a leap ahead for the domains at best prices and discounts. The perfect way to you Business online.
Buy a domain name and the world is your oyster. Domains are more than just addresses for your websites, they're also your online brand, which is why choosing the right one is so important. You want something that's unique, but still easy to remember. Thankfully, with dozens of Top-Level Domains to choose from, your options are virtually limitless. Your first task is to choose which extension you want (.COM, .NET, .CO) and register your domain name.
